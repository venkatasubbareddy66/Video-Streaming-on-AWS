Build a Video Streaming Service like YouTube, Netflix using AWS S3, CloudFront and React

Step 1 : Create a Bucket 

-- open console --> S3 --> create bucket with version enable and default encryption also enabled


Step 2 : open CloudFront and Create Distribution 

-- CloudFront --> Origin Access --> create control settings (name = Anyone, sign request recommended)

-- go to Distribution --> choose origin domain of urs --> Origin access = Origin access control settings (recommended), select ur OAC--> Viewer protocol policy = Redirect HTTP to HTTPS--> create Distribution

-- it will take some time to Distribution , copy the S3 bucket policy which shows u in the top 

-- change bucket Policy and save changes 

-- wait until the Distribution last modified is updated , until then do not proceed 

-- go to S3 bucket and upload any Video


Step 3 : Test

-- now copy domain name of ur distribution/copy ur bukcet object key paste in browser 

eg : https://dm0eedkwuteru.cloudfront.net/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4

-- now cloudfront and s3 connection is working for the Videostreaming purpose 


Step 4 : do try with the front-end (React) to deliver our content to customers 

-- open vscode 

-- npx create-react-app video-streaming-service     ---> enter this command to install all packages 

-- cd video-streaming-service 

-- npm start

-- it will created successfully 

-- delete the things that we do not need in the folder 

-- delete package.lock.json , in src --> delete logo.svg,report,etuptes , do delete if u do not want some files 

-- open App.js --> add some simple text 


 <h2>This is video tutorial practice on AWS</h2>
      <video width="700px" height="400px" controls> </video>
      <source src="https://dm0eedkwuteru.cloudfront.net/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
